# Nexus No Wait ++ 
### ***(snorkels Tweak)***

I have modified StrangeT's Nexus No Wait script with a few extra features, this includes automatically closing a tab once download has started, and notifing the user via a Javascript alet if the download has failed, or other error.

With this script you can download any files from Nexusmods.com without wait and redirect.
This support Manual/Vortex/MO2/NMM downloads.

***Features:***
- Skip countdown
- Skip redirect to the download option selection page
- Support all games and mod managers (via nxm links)
- Auto start download for direct file link (works great with modlists etc)
- Generate download button for archived files
- Automatically close tabs after download start +
- Notify user via alerts if there is an error with the download +
- Auto skip requirements popup/tab to directly download+


### The original script comes fully from https://greasyfork.org/en/users/426978-stranget , this is simply a modified version that I upkeep.

***I do belive this script may break Nexus Mods TOS. Use at your own risk.***
