# Nexus No Wait ++ 

Download from Nexusmods.com without wait (Manual/Vortex/MO2/NMM), Tweaked with extra features.

I have rewritten & modified "StrangeT"s Nexus No Wait script with a few extra features, this includes automatically closing a tab once download has started, and notifing the user via a Javascript alert if the download has failed. (or other errors)

With this script you can automatically download any files from nexusmods.com without wait.
This support Manual/Vortex/MO2/NMM downloads.

***Features:***
- Skip countdown
- Bypass redirect to the download option selection page
- Support all games and mod managers (via nxm links)
- Auto-start downloads for file_id= URLs (works great with modlists etc which often open these links expecting you to click each button manually)
- Automatically close tabs after file_id= URL download starts
- Generate download buttons for archived files
- Notify user via alerts & audio if there is an error with the download 
- Auto-skip requirements popup/tab and go directly to download 
- UI for configuration + (⚙️ button in bottom right corner)

⚠ **I do belive this script may break Nexus Mods TOS. Use at your own risk.**
